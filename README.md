### Hi there 👋

Highly skilled engineer with well-developed analytical, troubleshooting, and problem-solving skills. Proficient in multiple programming languages and technologies, I possess a strong understanding of software development principles and a proven track record of delivering high-quality solutions.

My main expertise lies in the Perl programming language. This language has provided me with great opportunities to work on large-scale projects and experience rapid growth.

I have production experience with writing services in languages Python and TypeScript, but I wouldn't call myself an expert :)

Currently, I'm improving my knowledge in GoLang and looking forward to applying it to open-source projects. Let me know if you need a hand.

I have a great understanding of the infrastructure domain and building services like API Gateways, Authentication, Caching, Task Queues, and Event systems. I am truly passionate about this domain and enjoy driving development towards a bright future.
