### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Software engineer with well-developed analytical, troubleshooting, and problem-solving skills. Proficient in multiple programming languages and technologies, I possess a strong understanding of software development principles and a proven track record of delivering high-quality solutions.

My main expertise lies in the Perl programming language. This language has provided me with great opportunities to work on large-scale projects and experience rapid growth.

I have production experience with writing services in languages Python and TypeScript, but I wouldn't call myself an expert :)

Currently, I'm improving my knowledge in GoLang and Rust and looking forward to applying it to open-source projects. Let me know if you need a hand.
